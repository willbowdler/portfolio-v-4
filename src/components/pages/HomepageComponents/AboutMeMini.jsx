          <p>
            I am a follower of Christ and I am a self-taught programmer with
            skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and WordPress. I began
            learning to code in July of 2021 after deciding that I wanted to
            pursue web development as my vocational trade. <br />
            <br />
            Since beginning to code, I have used a variety of avenues to
            self-teach, ranging from CodeCademy.com courses to Udemy lectures to
            YouTube videos. <br /> <br />
            While currently, I am doing most of my work on the front-end with
            JavaScript, React, and CSS, I am an aspiring full-stack developer
            with intentions to learn Node.js and Database langauges like SQL.
