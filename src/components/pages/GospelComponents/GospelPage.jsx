      <h1>The Gospel</h1>
      <div className="gospel-message">
        But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if
        only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the
        Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. Acts 20:24
        <br />
        <br />
        The man named Paul, the apostle Paul, spoke about a gospel, a message of
        good news, that he received from the Lord Jesus Christ. This gospel
        testifies to the good news of God's grace revealed in Jesus Christ. Paul
        refers to this gospel as "of first importance (1 Corinthians 15:3)".
        Therefore understanding the gospel and understanding His grace are the
        MOST important things to understand in all of the Scriptures. What then
        is God's grace, and what does it have to do with Jesus Christ?
        <br />
        <br />
        This passage of Scripture says it so well: "...all have sinned and fall
        short of the glory of God, and are justified by His grace as a gift,
        through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as
        a propitiation by His blood, to be received by faith." <br />
        There are many concepts here worthy of study, but I want to highlight
        five of them: <br /> • The sinfulness of man <br /> • Justified by grace
        <br /> • Redemption that is in Christ Jesus <br /> • Jesus as our
        propitiation <br /> • Salvation through faith
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>The Sinfulness of Man</h3>
        <p>
          God's word says that all of mankind has fallen short of His glory. It
          says this in other places. "None is righteous, no not one (Romans
          3:10)." "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good
          and never sins (Ecclesiastes 7:20)." To fall short of His glory means
          to fall short of His perfect righteous standard. The standard is that
          we reflect God's glory, His beauty, and His moral perfection, and we
          fall short of that. God's law shows us this so clearly. The
          commandments say "You shall not bear false witness," "You shall not
          use the name of the LORD your God in vain," "You shall not murder,"
          "You shall not commit adultery." You may say, "Well, I have never
          killed anyone." But Jesus emphasizes that God's law is not just broken
          by outwardly breaking the command, but also through the thoughts and
          intentions of our hearts. He says, "You have heard it said, 'You shall
          not commit adultery.' But I say to you that everyone who looks at
          woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in
          his heart."
        </p>

        <h3>Justified by Grace</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Redemption in Jesus Christ</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Jesus as our propitiation</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Salvation through faith</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        That is the gospel. It is the most important message you will ever hear,
        whether you are rich or poor, smart or foolish. The gospel is the
        message of God's everlasting salvation from sin and His wrath-for all
        who believe.
